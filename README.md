# Hi there!


I am a data science student currently enrolled at WBS Coding School with an academic backgound in theoretical physics!
Currently learning about Cloud Computing and Machine Learning, exploring real-world datasets using APIs and building impactful strategies and dashboards.
Looking forward to collaborate on mathematical problems and open-source project and sharing my learnings along the way!
